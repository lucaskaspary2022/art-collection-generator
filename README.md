Pixel NFT art + metadata planet collection generator
Python project where I created a collection of more than 2000 pixel art planets, which were later linked with an NFT contract in the Ethereum network. The generator took many different layers as input and randomized them to create a whole collection, manipulating the images' pixels to make each image unique. Additionally, the program also generated a JSON file of Metadata for each planet based on the main characteristics of the image and the layers they inherited.
